HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM
STEP 1: OPEN THE TERMINAL IN THIS PROGRAM'S FOLDER. TYPE CMD IN THE FILE LOCATION.
STEP 2: COMPILE THE PROGRAM. USE THE COMMAND: "javac *.java"
STEP 3: RUN THE PROGRAM WITH YOUR DESIRED INPUT. USE THE COMMAND "java ScannerInput input.txt < input.txt"
STEP 3.5: MAKE SURE TO TYPE THE COMMAND THIS WAY SINCE THE FIRST input.txt IS USED FOR THE OUTPUT FILES' NAMES 
AND THE SECOND input.txt GIVES THE INPUT ITSELF. IF THERE IS AN ALREADY EXISTING SCANNER OR PARSER OUTPUT FOR 
THE INPUT FILE'S NAME, IT WILL PROMPT TO DELETE THESE FILES TO AVOID DUPLICATES.
STEP 4: THE SCANNER WILL OUTPUT TO A FILE NAMED [Input file name without .txt]scan.txt AND THE PARSER WILL
OUTPUT TO A FILE NAMED [Input file name without .txt]parse.txt.
